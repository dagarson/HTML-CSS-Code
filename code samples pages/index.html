		<p>I have several hobbies that I will talk about in my website. first of all I love my car<br> as you can see on the right.
		It is a 2007 Mazda 3. Which to some may not seem<br>like much but I like it because itâ€™s my first car, I have even won a few races with that car. <br> I still remember the day I got that car just before I began Junior year of high school.<br> Compared to a lot of the other students I had one of the nicest cars in the parking lot.</p>
