		<p> I was born in michigan and was raised in portage. I like the area except for the weather. I like to travel and try new things which is why I have been to about 2/3 of the states in the USA.  I graduated from <a href="http://nhs.portageps.org/"> Portage Northern High school</a> in 2014.<a href="../Images/Brown-Huskie.png"><img class ="thumb3" src="../Images/Brown-Huskie.png"></a>  I work as an indepentant contractor for a company called Marketforce.</p>
		
<p> I am at<a href="https://www.kvcc.edu/"> Kalamazoo Valley</a> to get my degree in <a href="https://www.kvcc.edu/programs/business/sd.aas.php">Software Development,</a> which I plan to use to either go into the workforce or join some branch of the military and work with computers. I still have serveral classes that I have to take but I hope that I can keep pushing through and finish in a year.<a href="../Images/AccentMark.png"><img class ="thumb4" src="../Images/AccentMark.png"></a></p>
